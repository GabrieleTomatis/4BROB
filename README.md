# Description:
Our project consists in stimulating the memory of the patient by combining this with the stretching of the body.
To do this we used the p5 programming language using in particular the PoseNet library.
This library, helped us recognize body movements, to perform stretching exercises.
To recognize if the poses were done correctly, we trained a machine that could recognize these poses based on the position and movement of the body.
We also added a spaceship, which every time the player points, the rocket will advance, moving from planet to planet, reaching the earth, which will mark the playerâ€™s victory.
To ensure that the poses were replicated correctly, we decided to put tutorials to make our video game more cute and easier to interpret.

This game is designed specifically for people suffering from multiple sclerosis, going to strengthen and stimulate memory and body.

# Requisiti:
Per realizzare questo progetto abbiamo dovuto scaricare la libreria [PoseNet](https://www.tensorflow.org/install?hl=it)
